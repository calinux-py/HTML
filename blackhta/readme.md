# BlackHTA

**BlackHTA** is a demonstration script showcasing HTML-based vulnerabilities that allow the download of `.hta` (HTML Application) files, even without an active internet connection. This is intended to highlight the potential risks of untrusted HTML and `.hta` file interactions, especially in environments where restricted network access might be assumed as a safeguard.

## Features
- Simulates a software download page with custom animations and styles.
- Dynamically generates and downloads an `.hta` file, which executes commands on the local system upon opening.
- Demonstrates how malicious `.hta` files can still be generated and executed offline.
